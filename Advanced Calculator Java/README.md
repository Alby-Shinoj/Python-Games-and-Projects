### Brief
The above image shows the calculator we are building in this project. We can perform various mathematical operations & calculations just by typing in the equivalent characters given given on each button of the calculator in the image.

The user may refer to the image as GUI for the time being and type in characters which in turn will be interpreted by the calculator as various operators or operands and the results will be shown after calculation is performed.

- **Note** : The input is in the form of String consisting of lowercase characters only.

#### Mapping of characters
  ```
'a' --> 'R' or Square root
'b' --> '0'
'c' --> '.'
'd' --> '='
'e' --> '1'
'f' --> '2'
'g' --> '3'
'h' --> '+'
'i' --> '4'
'j' --> '5'
'l' --> '-'
'm' --> '7'
'n' --> '8'
'o' --> '9'
'p' --> '*'
'q' --> 'S' or Square
'r' --> 'F' or Fraction
's' --> 'C' or Clear/Restart
't' --> '/'
  ```
 ### Improvisations to be made
  - GUI to be added for the calculator to make the user experience more smooth


#### Credits:
I got this idea from an assigment given in a NPTEL course called [Programming in Java](https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc20_cs08/course). It was a good course to learn about Java.
